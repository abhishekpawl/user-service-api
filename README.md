# user-service-api
A basic API service to get started with Spring Boot framework.

1. In the project directory, to validate, compile, test, package, verify and generate the jar file, run
  ```
  mvn install
  ```

2. To run an instance of the jar file, run
  ```
  java -jar .\target\<NAME-OF-THE-JAR-FILE>.jar
