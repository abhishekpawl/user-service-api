# user-service-api
A basic API service to get started with Spring Boot framework.

Configure the database, user and password for database in [application.properties](https://github.com/abhishekpawl/user-service-api/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties).

1. In the project directory, to validate, compile, test, package, verify and generate the jar file, run
  ```
  mvn install
  ```

2. To run an instance of the jar file, run
  ```
  java -jar .\target\<NAME-OF-THE-JAR-FILE>.jar
  ```

The application will be up and running, and will be hosted on the default web server port 8080.
